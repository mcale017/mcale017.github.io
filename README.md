# Ryan McAleese's Portfolio

I. Template
------------
1. This template is called elate, and I found it online. It's completely free and legal to use this template.
2. https://bootstrapthemes.co/item/elate-free-html5-bootstrap-template/
3. I have modified some files to customize it for how I wanted it, and I've also deleted some unnecessary files that aren't being used.

II. Features
------------
1. Nav bar
2. Home
3. About Me
4. Portfolio
5. Contact
6. Stats
7. Footer

III. Future Considerations
------------
1. Nav bar at the fixed position at the top of the page. I'm hoping to make it always white and stay at top. It also tends to disappear when scrolled to the bottom and then back to the top.
2. About me section will be updated.
3. In portfolio section, I'm hoping to have each project item display its description when user hovers mouse over it.
4. Contact form that's not functional yet.
5. In stats section, I'm hoping to have their numbers update on its own.
6. For footer, that has buttons that will open the link to corresponding ones.
